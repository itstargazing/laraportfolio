## Key Features

- **Modern Dark Theme:**  
  A professionally designed dark interface with a black background and a consistent accent color (#778DA9) to ensure a sophisticated look and feel.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The layout is fully responsive, adapting gracefully to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. CSS Grid and Flexbox are employed to maintain a fluid and organized structure across all screen sizes.

- **Smooth Animations:**  
  Interactive elements and transitions are powered by the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). Scroll-triggered effects and timeline-based animations enhance the user experience without compromising performance.

- **Interactive Project Cards:**  
  Each project is presented as an interactive card. When clicked, these cards open detailed modal overlays that provide additional information about the project.

- **Dynamic Background Effects:**  
  The site incorporates subtle yet engaging background animations, including an animated dots background and an interactive particle canvas in the footer. These elements add depth to the design without detracting from the content.

- **Comprehensive Content Structure:**  
  - **About:** A brief professional introduction.  
  - **Projects:** A detailed showcase of creative and technical work with interactive modals for extended descriptions.  
  - **Services:** An outline of professional offerings and expertise.  
  - **Skills:** Visual representations of proficiency levels using animated progress bars.  
  - **Testimonials:** Feedback and endorsements from clients or collaborators.  
  - **Blog and Publications:** Sections dedicated to thought leadership and contributions.  
  - **Contact:** A fully styled form for inquiries and direct communication.

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:**  
  The website is built using semantic HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling. Modern layout techniques such as CSS Grid and Flexbox are used to create an adaptable and maintainable design.

- **JavaScript (ES6):**  
  Vanilla JavaScript is utilized for interactivity, handling events, and dynamic content updates. The code includes functionality for modal displays, background animations, and integration with GSAP.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):**  
  GSAP is used for creating smooth, high-performance animations. It manages scroll-triggered transitions and timeline-based effects that bring the design to life.

- **Custom CSS Variables:**  
  To ensure consistency and facilitate easy theming, key color values and design tokens are defined as CSS custom properties. This approach simplifies future modifications and design iterations.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized in a clear, logical manner to support efficient development and maintenance:

- **index.html:**  
  The primary file containing the complete HTML markup, embedded CSS, and JavaScript. This file encapsulates the entire website for simplicity.

- **Assets (Optional):**  
  A dedicated directory for additional resources (e.g., images, external CSS, and JavaScript files). Although the current version integrates most code within a single file, future enhancements may separate these assets.

- **Documentation Files:**  
  This README and any other documentation files provide detailed information regarding project setup, customization, and contribution guidelines.

## Installation and Setup

Follow the steps below to run the website locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/itstargazing/portfolio-website.git
   cd portfolio-website
   ```

2. **Launch the Website:**  
   You can open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred web browser. Alternatively, for a more robust development environment, use a local server. For example, if you have Python installed, run:
   
   ```
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   
   Then, navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Customization

This portfolio website is designed for ease of customization. Developers can modify various aspects without affecting the overall functionality:

- **Styling:**  
  Edit the CSS custom properties (e.g., `--bg-color`, `--text-color`) to adjust the color scheme. Modify the layout styles to update spacing, typography, and responsive behavior.

- **Content:**  
  Update the HTML content to add, remove, or rearrange sections. Each section is self-contained, making it straightforward to tailor content to specific needs.

- **Animations:**  
  GSAP animation parameters can be tweaked to change the duration, easing, and triggers of transitions. Developers may add additional animations as required.

- **Interactivity:**  
  The JavaScript code that handles modal behavior, background effects, and dynamic updates can be extended or refined. Consider integrating additional libraries or backend services if needed (e.g., for form submissions).
